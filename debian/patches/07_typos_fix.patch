Using \-\-skip would have resulted in sector \fIn\fR being the first sector also, but with IV \fIn\fR.

 LUKS uses PBKDF2 to protect against dictionary attacks (see RFC 2898). 
 LUKS will always use SHA1 in HMAC mode, and no other mode is supported at the moment.

 For any password creation action (luksAddKey, or luksFormat), the user specify, how much the time the password processing should consume. 
 Increasing the time will lead to a more secure password, but also will take luksOpen longer to complete. The default setting of one second is sufficient for good security.
 .SH NOTES ON PASSWORDS
-Mathematic can't be bribed. Make sure you keep your passwords safe. There are a few nice tricks for constructing a fallback, when suddely out of (or after being) blue, your brain refuses to cooperate. These fallbacks are possible with LUKS, as it's only possible with LUKS to have multiple passwords.
